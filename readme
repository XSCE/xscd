This folder contains the scripts to load content onto a school server. In 
addition, there are folders of content to be loaded which must be available 
to the scripts.

The disk from which the install takes place must have a folder XC in the 
root. This folder name is recognized by a usbmount and a script xc-install 
in this folder is executed. 

Each content element has a folder in XC such as xc-wiki. This folder has 
a script: xc-wiki-install. That script installs the wiki content. 

Also, this folder must contain the content.

The following is a guide to the content required in each folder and where 
it may be found. This content is not considered appropriate for version
